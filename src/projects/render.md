This is a physics-based path tracer implemented in C++. It features path tracing with multiple importance sampling,
quasi-Monte Carlo sampling, texture mapping, various microfacet models and integrators, and volumetric 
rendering. 

Several methods for rendering heterogenous media are implemented including ratio and 
delta tracking, analog decomposition tracking, spectral tracking, and spectral multiple importance sampling.
