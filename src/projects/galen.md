Galen is an iOS app and platform which combines state-of-the-art speech to text recognition, few-shot text parsing, and medical data analysis to prevent surgical errors.

Galen aims to keep track of surgical actions and verify that they are safe. To do so, it analyzes surgical audio using [Whisper](https://openai.com/blog/whisper/) and GPT-3 and certifies that each surgical operation is safe with respect to patient information and an existing [database of drug interactions](https://snap.stanford.edu/biodata/datasets/10002/10002-ChG-Miner.html). 

This project received Best Distributed Systems Hack and placed 2nd in the iOS Development Challenge and YC Startup Pitch at [HackMIT 2022](https://dayof.hackmit.org/#home).
