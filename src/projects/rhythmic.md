rhythmic.live is a collaborative music making platform providing audio synchronization, interactive and browser-compatible sheet music,
and informative analytics.

Musicions can join a recording session from the web app which a conductor manages. When a session begins,
separate recording sessions are started and the audio streams are reconstructed in sync and stored. After each recording, the conductor
can browse recent recordings, listem to them, and receive algorithmic feedback about tone, timbre, and rhythm.

This project won the NASDAQ Music Challenge at [HackMIT 2020](https://archive.hackmit.org/2020/).
